# Restaurant-Website
A website I created for a made-up restaurant using CSS and HTML. The main feature of my website is the menu, which I created using CSS grids. 
CSS flexbox was used throughout the site to position elements. The website is responsive and is formatted for tablet and mobile devices. The appearance of elements such as the navigation bar and 
menu layout change depending on screen size.
